## Essential Skills for Success

### Project Management & Breaking Down Work
- **Iteration is key** - Long assignments require breaking work into smaller pieces and building incrementally
- **Clear planning matters** - Creating GitHub issues, timelines, and roadmaps (as practiced in CSP) is crucial
- **API-first design** - Design interfaces before coding to think through architecture
- **Separate concerns** - Understand frontend vs. backend requirements and minimum viable features

### Communication Skills
- **Code documentation** - Meaningful commit messages and comments are essential
- **Verbal explanation** - Being able to talk through your code line by line
- **Technical writing** - Document new learnings to share with team members
- **User-focused language** - Explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- **Pair programming** - Practice explaining code with partners to build communication skills

### User-Centered Development
- **Research first** - Conduct multiple rounds of user research before settling on solutions
- **Silent observation** - Give customers the product without explanation and watch how they use it
- **Iterate based on feedback** - Use customer insights to improve and refine
- **Put users first** - Always think about who you're building for and what problems you're solving

## Advice for High School Students

### Academic Approach
1. **Balance work and enjoyment** - Work hard but have fun while learning
2. **Research college programs** - Look at project-based vs. lecture-based courses
3. **Explore beyond your degree** - Check what courses are offered outside CS department
4. **Start with interests** - Write down ideas based on what you're passionate about

### Professional Growth
1. **Build your network** - Keep in touch with people you learn from
2. **Take initiative** - Reach out to professionals; many are willing to help high schoolers
3. **Send follow-ups** - Maintain connections and expand your network
4. **Put yourself out there** - Don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help
5. **Control your learning** - Be proactive about what you want to learn

### Technical Skills
1. **Start learning CS earlier if possible** - The earlier you start, the better foundation you'll have
2. **Practice explaining your code** - Technical communication is crucial for interviews
3. **Use AI as a learning tool** - ChatGPT and other tools can help explain concepts
4. **Create diagrams** - Visual representations help clarify complex code
