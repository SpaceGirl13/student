## AP CSP Trimester 1 Retrospective

## Reflecting on My Growth

At the beginning of the year, I had marked myself down on technical skills such as cyber talk and overall tech growth. I believe that I have improved significantly in both of those areas. Giving the presentations about the fundamentals of JavaScript and Python really helped me develop confidence in technical talk by explaining not only what my code does, but why it does it. 

I also believe that I have improved in organization, something I had marked myself down on at the beginning of the year. Back then, my repositories were scattered across random folders and on my desktop. Now, I have organized them neatly and made sure everything is in the right place. These changes have helped me stay focused, collaborate more effectively, and track my work through GitHub more professionally.

Overall, I can see that my growth this semester goes beyond learning how to code. It is about learning how to think, communicate, and organize like a real developer.

## Sprint Highlights

### **Sprint 2: Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python**
I learned a lot from this sprint, especially by seeing how the coding exercises we did connected to something bigger like building a game. Our lesson focused on developing algorithms, which was a new concept for me, and being able to visualize that through our Peppa Maze Game was extremely helpful. Understanding how the game used algorithms to determine how to move and where to go made the concept of algorithmic thinking click for me. It also gave me confidence in connecting abstract code to real-world applications.

### **Spring 3: Digital Famine**
Through this sprint, I learned how to collaborate better in a team rather than just doing all the work myself. As assistant scrum master, I was able to divide responsibility and encourage group brainstorming, which were beneficial for thinking of new ideas that made the project more engaging and interactive. My favorite part of this project was working on integrating it with the API.

## N@tM (Night at the Museum) Reflection

N@tM was really exciting for me because we finally got to present our project and demonstrate the interactive features we worked on. We explained how our program worked and invited visitors to type prompts to see how different AI models would respond. People really liked our feature where you could input a prompt and then see what the output would look like based on the type of AI used and the quality of the prompt.

That meant a lot to me because we spent a long time debugging that feature and getting the API calls to work correctly. A few people commented that our project “felt like a real AI experiment,” which made me proud of the work we did to make it both educational and interactive.

## What I Want to Learn Next in Computer Science

I would like to dive deeper into APIs. I was fascinated by how we were able to use them for our Digital Famine project, but I would like to go beyond just calling APIs. I want to understand how they actually work, what is happening in the background, and what else we can build with them. I am especially curious about how APIs connect different systems and how developers can use them to power AI tools, web apps, and data integrations.

## MCQ Review - Score, Corrections, and Approach

Below are my MCQs that I got wrong, grouped by concept. For each, I included the correction and the key idea I need to focus on to get it right next time.

---

### **Category: Software Development Process and Policies**

**Q9 - Benefits of Incremental and Iterative Development**  
- **My Answer:** C  
- **Correct Answer:** D  
- **Correction:** Iterative development helps programmers identify errors as components are added and tested incrementally.  
- **Key Concept:** Iteration provides early feedback and helps catch errors sooner.

**Q40 - Midterm/Final Grade Replacement Policy**  
- **My Answer:** B (I and II only)  
- **Correct Answer:** D (I, II, and III)  
- **Correction:** The data allows you to determine all three average total points, average increase, and proportion of students who improved.  
- **Key Concept:** When datasets include both input and output values, you can compute averages, differences, and proportions from the records.

---

### **Category: Data Interpretation**

**Social Media Data Table - Mobile App Release Effect**  
- **My Answer:** A  
- **Correct Answer:** D  
- **Correction:** The average characters per message dropped sharply, showing users started writing shorter messages after the mobile app release.  
- **Key Concept:** Identify which data trend best supports each hypothesis.

---

### **Category: Binary and Data Representation**

**Minimum Bits for 200 Characters**  
- **My Answer:** B (6 bits)  
- **Correct Answer:** D (8 bits)  
- **Correction:** 2^8 = 256 is the smallest power of 2 that covers 200 values.  
- **Key Concept:** Use powers of two (2^n) to determine bit capacity.

---

### **Category: Algorithm Design**

**Word Game Algorithm (Shorten / Keep Palindromes / Sort)**  
- **My Answer:** B (II only)  
- **Correct Answer:** D (II and III)  
- **Correction:** Both orders (II and III) work since sorting can occur before or after filtering, and palindromes must be selected before shortening.  
- **Key Concept:** Think about operation dependencies. Filtering should happen before transformations that remove needed data.

---

### **Category: Data Storage and Archival**

**Media Librarian Archival Question**  
- **My Answer:** C  
- **Correct Answer:** B  
- **Correction:** Lossy compression removes quality permanently. Expandable storage supports long-term archiving.  
- **Key Concept:** For full-quality data preservation, avoid lossy compression and use redundancy with standard formats.

---

### **Category: Abstraction and Code Organization**

**Using Abstraction to Manage Complexity (Select Two)**  
- **My Answer:** A only  
- **Correct Answer:** A and D  
- **Correction:** Using procedures and lists are both forms of abstraction that simplify programs.  
- **Key Concept:** Abstraction hides details using procedures or data structures.

---

### **Category: Data Integration**

**Combining School Data Sets**  
- **My Answers:** A and B  
- **Correct Answers:** A and B  
- **Correction:** Both schools provide names and absence data, allowing sorting and average calculations.  
- **Key Concept:** Confirm each dataset contains the fields you need before combining for analysis.

---

### **Category: Search Algorithms**

**Procedure Contains(list, target)**  
- **My Answer:** C (I and III)  
- **Correct Answer:** B (II only)  
- **Correction:** This is a linear search, not binary, and does not require sorting.  
- **Key Concept:** Linear search checks each element one by one, while binary search divides the search space but requires sorted data.

## MCQ Strategy Moving Forward

For my next round of MCQs, I want to focus less on guessing and more on understanding the reasoning behind each question. I’ve learned that most AP Computer Science questions test concepts I already know, but I sometimes miss them because I rush or don’t fully break down what’s being asked.  

Here’s how I plan to improve:  
1. **Recognize the concept first.** Before reading the options, I’ll identify whether the question is about algorithms, data, abstraction, or logic.  
2. **Look for key details.** Many wrong answers can be ruled out just by noticing one keyword or condition that doesn’t fit.  
3. **Think through examples.** I’ll imagine a quick real-world example or small list of data to test whether the logic makes sense.  
4. **Slow down and rephrase.** Putting the question into my own words helps me see what it’s really asking.  
5. **Learn from mistakes.** When I get something wrong, I’ll go back to the concept and make sure I understand *why* the correct answer works instead of just memorizing it.  

This approach helps me turn MCQs into learning tools rather than just practice questions.

## Final Thoughts

This class has taught me far more than syntax. It has shown me how computer science connects logic, creativity, and communication. From organizing my code repositories to debugging complex API features, I have grown into a more confident, thoughtful programmer. I am proud of how far I have come this trimester and am excited to learn more.
